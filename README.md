# üï∂Ô∏è Unbanned

A simple Electron app to remove Ray-Ban Meta identifiers from your photos and videos before sharing them online.

## What it does

Unbanned helps you maintain privacy by stripping metadata that could identify your Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses from your media files. It removes:

- Camera make/model information
- Device-specific comments
- EXIF metadata that identifies the device
- QuickTime metadata in videos

## Features

- üñ±Ô∏è **Easy to use** - Simple drag-and-drop interface
- üìÅ **Flexible input** - Select individual files, multiple files, or entire folders
- üìÇ **Smart output** - Choose destination folder or create new ones
- üìä **Progress tracking** - See real-time progress as files are processed
- üé® **Modern design** - Clean, professional interface
- üîí **Privacy focused** - Removes device identifiers while preserving image quality

## Supported File Types

- **Photos**: JPG, JPEG, HEIC
- **Videos**: MOV, MP4

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Setup

1. **Clone or download** this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kbroose/unbanned.git
   cd unbanned
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Launch the app** - Run `npm start` from the project directory
2. **Select source** - Click "Source files or folder" to choose what to process
   - You can select individual files, multiple files, or an entire folder
3. **Choose destination** - Click "Destination folder" to select where cleaned files will be saved
   - You can create a new folder during this step
4. **Clean files** - Click "Clean Files" to start the process

## Building for Distribution

To create a standalone app that others can download and run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create distributable versions for macOS, Windows, and Linux in the `dist` folder.

## How it Works

Unbanned uses [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) to remove specific metadata fields from your media files:

- `Make` and `Model` - Camera manufacturer and model info
- `EXIF:Make` and `EXIF:Model` - EXIF-specific device identifiers
- `Comment` and `QuickTime:Comment` - Device-specific comments

The app copies your original files to the destination folder and then strips the metadata, preserving your originals.

## Privacy & Security

- **No data sent online** - Everything happens locally on your computer
- **Original files preserved** - Your source files are never modified
- **Open source** - You can review the code to verify what it does
